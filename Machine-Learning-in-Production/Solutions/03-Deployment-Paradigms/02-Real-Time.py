# MAGIC %md # Real Time Deployment
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC While real time deployment represents a smaller share of the deployment landscape, many of these deployments represent high value tasks.  This lesson surveys real-time deployment options ranging from proofs of concept to both custom and managed solutions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## ![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) In this lesson you:<br>
# MAGIC  - Survey the landscape of real-time deployment options
# MAGIC  - Prototype a RESTful service using MLflow
# MAGIC  - Deploy registered models using MLflow Model Serving
# MAGIC  - Query an MLflow Model Serving endpoint for inference using individual records and batch requests
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_note_32.png"> *You need [cluster creation](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/model-serving.html#requirements) permissions to create a model serving endpoint. The instructor will either demo this notebook or enable cluster creation permission for the students from the Admin console.*

# MAGIC ### The Why and How of Real Time Deployment
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Real time inference is...<br><br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Generating predictions for a small number of records with fast results (e.g. results in milliseconds)
# MAGIC * The first question to ask when considering real time deployment is: do I need it?  
# MAGIC   - It represents a minority of machine learning inference use cases &mdash; it's necessary when features are only available at the time of serving
# MAGIC   - Is one of the more complicated ways of deploying models
# MAGIC   - That being said, domains where real time deployment is often needed are often of great business value.  
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC Domains needing real time deployment include...<br><br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC  - Financial services (especially with fraud detection)
# MAGIC  - Mobile
# MAGIC  - Ad tech

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC There are a number of ways of deploying models...<br><br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Many use REST
# MAGIC * For basic prototypes, MLflow can act as a development deployment server
# MAGIC   - The MLflow implementation is backed by the Python library Flask
# MAGIC   - *This is not intended to for production environments*
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In addition, Databricks offers a managed **MLflow Model Serving** solution. This solution allows you to host machine learning models from Model Registry as REST endpoints that are automatically updated based on the availability of model versions and their stages.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For production RESTful deployment, there are two main options...<br><br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * A managed solution 
# MAGIC   - Azure ML
# MAGIC   - SageMaker (AWS)
# MAGIC   - VertexAI (GCP)
# MAGIC * A custom solution  
# MAGIC   - Involve deployments using a range of tools
# MAGIC   - Often using Docker or Kubernetes
# MAGIC * One of the crucial elements of deployment in containerization
# MAGIC   - Software is packaged and isolated with its own application, tools, and libraries
# MAGIC   - Containers are a more lightweight alternative to virtual machines
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Finally, embedded solutions are another way of deploying machine learning models, such as storing a model on IoT devices for inference.

# MAGIC %md-sandbox ## Prototyping with MLflow
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow offers <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#pyfunc-deployment" target="_blank">a Flask-backed deployment server for development purposes only.</a>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's build a simple model below. This model will always predict 5.

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow
import mlflow.pyfunc
from mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature
import pandas as pd

class TestModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):
  
    def predict(self, context, input_df):
        return 5

model_run_name="pyfunc-model"

with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    model = TestModel()
    mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(artifact_path=model_run_name, python_model=model)
    model_uri = f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/{model_run_name}"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md There are a few ways to send requests to the development server for testing purpose:
# MAGIC * using `click` library 
# MAGIC * using MLflow Model Serving API
# MAGIC * through CLI using `mlflow models serve`
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this lesson, we are going to demonstrate how to use both the `click` library and MLflow Model Serving API. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_note_24.png"/> This is just to demonstrate how a basic development server works. This design pattern (which hosts a server on the driver of your Spark cluster) is not recommended for production.<br>
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_note_24.png"/> Models can be served in this way in other languages as well.

# MAGIC ### Method 2: MLflow Model Serving
# MAGIC Now, let's use MLflow Model Serving. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Step 1: We first need to register the model in MLflow Model Registry and load the model. At this step, we don't specify the model stage, so that the stage version would be `None`. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can refer to the MLflow documentation [here](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#api-workflow).

# MAGIC %md ## AWS SageMaker
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - [mlflow.sagemaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/index.html) can deploy a trained model to SageMaker using a single function: `mlflow.sagemaker.deploy`
# MAGIC - During deployment, MLflow will use a specialized Docker container with the resources required to load and serve the model. This container is named `mlflow-pyfunc`.
# MAGIC - By default, MLflow will search for this container within your AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). You can build and upload this container to ECR using the
# MAGIC `mlflow.sagemaker.build_image()` function in MLflow. Alternatively, you can specify an alternative URL for this container by setting an environment variable as follows:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC   # the ECR URL should look like:
# MAGIC   {account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{repo_name}:{tag}
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC   # Set the environment variable based on the URL
# MAGIC   os.environ["SAGEMAKER_DEPLOY_IMG_URL"] = "<ecr-url>"
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC - You can contact your Databricks representative for a prebuilt `mlflow-pyfunc` image URL in ECR (in private preview).
# MAGIC - Once the endpoint is up and running, the `sagemaker-runtime` API in `boto3` can query against the REST API:
# MAGIC ```python
# MAGIC client = boto3.session.Session().client("sagemaker-runtime", "{region}")
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC   response = client.invoke_endpoint(
# MAGIC       EndpointName=app_name,
# MAGIC       Body=inputs,
# MAGIC       ContentType='application/json; format=pandas-split'
# MAGIC   )
# MAGIC   preds = response['Body'].read().decode("ascii")
# MAGIC   preds = json.loads(preds)
# MAGIC   print(f"Received response: {preds}")
# MAGIC   ```
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ** Tip: Each Sagemaker endpoint is scoped to a single region. If deployment is required across regions, Sagemaker endpoints must exist in each region. **

# MAGIC ## Azure
# MAGIC - AzureML and MLflow can deploy models as [REST endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-mlflow-models) by using either:
# MAGIC   - **Azure Container Instances**: when deploying through ACI, it automatically registers the model, creates and registers the container (if one doesn't already exist), builds the image, and sets up the endpoint. The endpoint can then be monitored via the AzureML studio UI. **Note that Azure Kubernetes Service is generally recommended for production over ACI.**
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC   <img src="http://files.training.databricks.com/images/mlflow/rest_serving.png" style="height: 700px; margin: 10px"/>
# MAGIC   - **Azure Kubernetes Service**: when deploying through AKS, the K8s cluster is configured as the compute target, use the `deployment_configuration()` [function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.aks.akswebservice?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-configuration-autoscale-enabled-none--autoscale-min-replicas-none--autoscale-max-replicas-none--autoscale-refresh-seconds-none--autoscale-target-utilization-none--collect-model-data-none--auth-enabled-none--cpu-cores-none--memory-gb-none--enable-app-insights-none--scoring-timeout-ms-none--replica-max-concurrent-requests-none--max-request-wait-time-none--num-replicas-none--primary-key-none--secondary-key-none--tags-none--properties-none--description-none--gpu-cores-none--period-seconds-none--initial-delay-seconds-none--timeout-seconds-none--success-threshold-none--failure-threshold-none--namespace-none--token-auth-enabled-none--compute-target-name-none--cpu-cores-limit-none--memory-gb-limit-none-) create a json configuration file for the compute target, the model is then registered and the cluster is ready for serving. Because Azure Kubernetes services inlcudes features like load balancing, fallover, etc. it's a more robust production serving option. 
# MAGIC   - Azure Machine Learning endpoints (currently in preview)
# MAGIC - Note that when you're deploying your model on Azure, you'll need to connect the [MLflow Tracking URI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow) from your Databricks Workspace to your AzureML workspace. Once the connection has been created, experiments can be tracked across the two. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ** Tip:`azureml-mlflow` will need to be installed on the cluster as it is *not* included in the ML runtime ** 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md-sandbox 
# MAGIC ## GCP
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC GCP users can train their models on GCP Databricks workspace, log their trained model to MLFlow Model Registry, then deploy production-ready models to [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and create model-serving endpoint. You need to set up your GCP service account and install MLflow plugin for Google Cloud (`%pip install google_cloud_mlflow`).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ####**To set up GCP service account**:
# MAGIC - Create a GCP project, see intructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started). You can use the project that the Databricks workspace belongs to.
# MAGIC - Enable Vertex AI and Cloud Build APIs of your GCP project
# MAGIC - Create a service account with the following minimum IAM permissions (see instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)) to load Mlflow models from GCS, build containers, and deploy the container into a Vertex AI endpoint:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC cloudbuild.builds.create
# MAGIC cloudbuild.builds.get
# MAGIC storage.objects.create
# MAGIC storage.buckets.create
# MAGIC storage.buckets.get
# MAGIC aiplatform.endpoints.create
# MAGIC aiplatform.endpoints.deploy
# MAGIC aiplatform.endpoints.get
# MAGIC aiplatform.endpoints.list
# MAGIC aiplatform.endpoints.predict
# MAGIC aiplatform.models.get
# MAGIC aiplatform.models.upload
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Create a cluster and attach the service account to your cluster. Compute --> Create Cluster --> (After normal configurations are done) Advanced options --> Google Service Account --> type in your Service Account email --> start cluster
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/mlflow/gcp_image_2.png" style="height: 700px; margin: 10px"/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ####**Create an endpoint of a logged model with the MLflow and GCP python API**
# MAGIC - Install the following libraries in a notebook:
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC %pip install google_cloud_mlflow
# MAGIC %pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Deployment
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC import mlflow
# MAGIC from mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC vtx_client = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client("google_cloud") # Instantiate VertexAI client
# MAGIC deploy_name = <enter-your-deploy-name>
# MAGIC model_uri = <enter-your-mlflow-model-uri>
# MAGIC deployment = vtx_client.create_deployment(
# MAGIC     name=deploy_name,
# MAGIC     model_uri=model_uri,
# MAGIC     # config={}   # set deployment configurations, see an example: https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-mlflow/
# MAGIC     )
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC The code above will do the heavy lifting depolyment, i.e. export the model from MLflow to Google Storage, imports the model from Google Storage, and generates the image in VertexAI. **It might take 20 mins for the whole deployment to complete.** 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Note:**
# MAGIC - If `destination_image_uri` is not set, then `gcr.io/<your-project-id>/mlflow/<deploy_name>` will be used
# MAGIC - Your service account must have access to that storage location in Cloud Build
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Get predictions from the endpoint
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - First, retrieve your endpoint:
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC deployments = vtx_client.list_deployments()
# MAGIC endpt = [d["resource_name"] for d in deployments if d["name"] == deploy_name][0]
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Then use `aiplatform` module from `google.cloud` to query the generated endpoint. 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC from google.cloud import aiplatform
# MAGIC aiplatform.init()
# MAGIC vtx_endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(endpt_resource)
# MAGIC arr = X_test.tolist() ## X_test is an array
# MAGIC pred = vtx_endpoint.predict(instances=arr)
# MAGIC ```

# MAGIC ## Review
# MAGIC **Question:** What are the best tools for real time deployment?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** This depends largely on the desired features.  The main tools to consider are a way to containerize code and either a REST endpoint or an embedded model.  This covers the vast majority of real time deployment options.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Question:** What are the best options for RESTful services?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** The major cloud providers all have their respective deployment options.  In the Azure environment, Azure ML manages deployments using Docker images. This provides a REST endpoint that can be queried by various elements of your infrastructure.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Question:** What factors influence REST deployment latency?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** Response time is a function of a few factors.  Batch predictions should be used when needed since it improves throughput by lowering the overhead of the REST connection.  Geo-location is also an issue, as is server load.  This can be handled by geo-located deployments and load balancing with more resources.
